### The challenge
The challenge was to use create a calendar that would dynamically display the HTML and CSS functions for a 8 hour schedule. We also had to make sure that information stored in each hour would be saved to the local storage and still be present even if the page was refreshed. The current date and time also had to be integerated into the scheduler.

### User Story
When the user utilizes the calendar, they should be able to distinguish their scheduled based on the past, present and future time. After referencing the current date and time, the user is able to store information in each hour timeblock and once they refresh that page, the information will be saved and not be deleted.

### Acceptance Criteria
-The current date needs to be displayed
-The standard work hours needs to be displayed in a timeblock
-The timeblocks need to be differentiated in three different colors for the past, present and future
-Each timeblock should have the functionality to store information in the block
-Changes in the timeblock need to be saved to the local storage
-All changes need to be saved even when the page is refreshed

### Built with

-CSS
-Jquery
-Moment
-Javascript

### What I learned

What I learned from this challenge was seeing firsthand was how we could dynamically change the HTML and CSS functions. It was really intersting to see how we were able to apply colors in the CSS to our if statement. We also got to see how moment could not only display the current time but also be implemented into our code to track the hours in real time. The challenge also gave me exposure to working with Jquery to pares and storing items into the local storage. 

### Continued development

For future projects, I would love to work on creating more schedules. The current challenge had us working on a work calendar but I would also be interested in creating a calendar for students where each day has a different time frame. 

### Useful resources

- Class activites for week 5 - This was the best resource that I used on this challenge. The explanations were very straightforward and easy to apply and understand. Specific examples that were used were parsing and using Jquery,

I worked on this assignment with Asha Chakre, Daniel Holloway and Dennis Nguyen.
Working with these three people not only helped me greatly with the assignment but I also had a chance to evaluate my process of studying and applying course material. They all really helped me understand the functionality behind the homework.
